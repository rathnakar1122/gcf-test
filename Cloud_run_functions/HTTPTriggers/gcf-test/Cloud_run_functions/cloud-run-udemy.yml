Google cloud Function:
 --> Auto Scaling
 --> Run time support --> java, python, node, and Go
 --> pricing model will be the pay as you go 
            * first 2 millians is for free 
            * after that 0.40 per millian request.
 --> pricing depends on memory & compute aslo 
 --> each function execution is independent 
 --> function execution has timeout 
          * defalut is 1 min and max 50 sec (9 minuyes )

Case --> 1:
--> We are Going to deploy One Google cloud fucntion having a http based trigger
--> in case of testing we are manually hit the URL of http though which this cloud invoation will happen 
--> INstead of manually hitting the URL as a HTTP trigger instead we are going to use in the particular use case as a Git hub webhook servcer
--> Http Url manually via our browser, Now we are going to intergrate with Github webhook.
we are going to Integrate with the slack APi.


-->  API the chat message service a slcak to send a message at some particular channel to this slack.
We are going to use a two different third party service integration:

One is instead of manually hitting the URL, we are going to use GitHub webhook.
And second one is we are going to integrate with the Slack message, send message API.

we are going to send slack message and send message to API:

Function - 2 : Cloud  Firestore & Pubsub : 
In this section we will deploy cloud function having firestore NOSQL database trigger & forward data to Cloud PubSub for further Processing:

Filestore Trigger --> google cloud function --> google cloud pubsub

File stores are like No sql databases

===============================================================================:
===============================================================================:
Function - 3 : Face Detection with Vision API 
 In this section we will deploy cloud function having Google Cloud Storage trigger & use Cloud Vision API for face detection.

Google cloud storage --> Google cloud functions --> Google cloud storage product 
whenever we create any object inside the Google Cloud storage, our function, Google Cloud function will be executed
This cloud function will detect a face, coordinate that inside the image, whatever you have uploaded in a Google cloud storage where exactly your face coordinates reside

=======================================================================================:
Function - 4 : Cloud Pubsub & Twillo Integration : 
In this section we will deploy cloud function with Cloud pubsub trigger  & send sms with Twillo API.

1. HttP: trigger :

import functions_framework


@functions_framework.http
def httop_trigger(request):   
    request_json = request.get_json(silent=True)
    request_args = request.args



2. Event Trigger:

umport functions_framwork 

@ functions_framwork.cloud_event

def event_trigger(cloud_event):
    data - cloud_event.data
    bucket = data ["bucket"]
    name = data ["name"]

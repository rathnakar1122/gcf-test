cloud run functions:

is a execution environment provided by cloud plotforms that enables run your code in responce to events withput managing by any underlying infrastrutures
1. Event driven execution 
2. Serverless 
3. pay as you go 
4. Languages support

it's a servicess computing build applications
Computing is analysis services 
Serverless is a compute come serverless 

#RUN your code with Zero servcer Management using scalable pay as you go functions services (FAAS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
it is used to for devlepment and deployment:

develop
1.Console - Inline editor 
2.Local Ide - SDK support

deployment:

1.Console
2.Test and Deployment from Locally. Yes

Trigger:
1. Cloud scheduler.
2.workflows
3.Evener based.

Benefints of cloud functions:
scalability,
co-effective 
Rapid Devlopment

When to use the Cloud functions:

Microservices
Data processing 
IoT and mobile
Automated workflows

Event based triggers:
Deplying cloud functions:
Cloud Console
Gcloud CLI

Runtime environment and Runtimes:
Languages Runtime --> cloud functions supports Node Js, python and Go and Java . .Net Node js.
execution environment
Memory and CPU  --> 


Scaling and Concurrency:
auto Scaling
Concurrency

Moniteting and Logging:


ways to use:
===========

Devlop:
1.console - inline efitor
2.Local IDE - SDK support

Deployment:
1.console
2.Test and deployment from locally* Yes

Trigger:
------
1.cloud scheduler
2.workflows
3.Event base/Http Trigger.


========================
Cloud Functions:
cloud run.
cloud build
GCS bucket.
artifacrigistry .
Log explorer

python 
SQL.

===================:
==================:
Devloping cloud run function and deploying from LOcal :




Basic syntax of UDF in python:
  def function_name <parameter>:
        function_body
        return <statement>

  function_name (args1, arg2)


2. Application of python UDFs with gcp cloud run functions:
a) CRF with HTTP trugger: Done  
b ) cef with event based trigger: 
    note: event must be happen in the one of the gcp service....
          example : cloud storage , Bigquery, pubsub

realtime - most - of the - CRF - functions:
     E1. Object finalized  : when an object placed in gcs buckt. Or when an exsting objet is overwritten we call that object is finalized
Requirement:
    - whenever a clinet or a vendor uploads a .txt file or .csv file into gcs bucket 



Question:
what is URI:
 -->Universal resource identifier
what is Url:
 -->Universal resource locator
what is the use of f-string in python:
  --> 
what is the use format in string functions' of python:
  --> 

1.HTTP:/

import functinon_framwkwork
@functions_framework.http
def http_function_example(request):
    json_data = request.get_json(silent=True)
    request_args = request.args
2.Event /

import functions_framework
@functions_framewrok.cloud_event

def gcstobigqueryload(cloud_event):
  data = cloud_event.data
  bucket = data["bucket"]
  name = data["name"]
  



-->
1. Intial Load
2.Incremental Load:
        --> Transactioons/facts table:
                orders, concellation orders , sales, cancellation
        --> Dimention table:
                customer , product, suks, discounts 

        SCD types:
            --> SCD type0, 1,2,3,4,5
